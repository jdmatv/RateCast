    Your task is to use Fermi-style reasoning to decompose the question into discrete, esimatable base rates. Unlike a 
    traditional Fermi problem, you will not estimate the final answer, but rather provide a list of specfic base rates 
    that can be used to estimate the probability through different approaches.
